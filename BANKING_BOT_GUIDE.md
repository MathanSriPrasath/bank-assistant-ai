## Technical Implementation

### Backend (service/app.py)

The bot's boundaries are enforced through a strict system instruction in the `get_general_llm_response()` function:

```python
system_instruction = """You are Cardy AI, a professional banking assistant for a bank. 
Your role is STRICTLY limited to banking services and financial assistance.

**Your Capabilities:**
- Account inquiries and management
- Loan information and applications
- Branch locations and services
- Transaction queries
- Credit/debit card services
- Banking products and services
- Financial advice related to banking
- Customer support for banking issues

**Important Rules:**
1. ONLY answer banking and financial service related questions
2. If asked about ANYTHING outside banking, politely decline and redirect
3. Be professional, courteous, and helpful for all banking queries
4. Never pretend to help with non-banking tasks
5. Always stay within your banking assistant role
"""
```

### Frontend Updates

1. **Login Screen:** Emphasizes "Banking Assistant"
2. **Welcome Message:** Clearly states banking-only services
3. **Chat Placeholder:** Mentions "banking services"
4. **Empty State:** Shows banking capabilities
5. **Post-Login Message:** Lists banking services available

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Login

## Customization for Other Use Cases

If you want to make this a **general-purpose chatbot** instead:

### Option 1: Remove Banking Restrictions

In `service/app.py`, change the system instruction to:

```python
system_instruction = """You are a helpful AI assistant. 
You can help with a wide range of topics including but not limited to:
- General knowledge
- Shopping recommendations
- Entertainment
- Banking (when user is logged in)
- And much more!

Be helpful, friendly, and provide accurate information on any topic the user asks about.
"""
```

### Option 2: Hybrid Approach

```python
system_instruction = """You are a versatile AI assistant with banking expertise.

**Primary Focus:** Banking and financial services
**Secondary:** General assistance when banking context not applicable

If the user asks banking questions, prioritize accurate banking information.
For non-banking queries, you may assist but always remind them of your banking capabilities.
"""
```

## Testing the Banking Boundaries

### Test Cases

**Banking Queries (Should Work):**
1. "What's my account balance?"
2. "How do I apply for a loan?"
3. "Where is the nearest branch?"
4. "What are my recent transactions?"
5. "Tell me about savings accounts"

**Non-Banking Queries (Should Decline):**
1. "What's the best pizza place nearby?"
2. "Can you help me write code?"
3. "What's the capital of France?"
4. "Recommend a movie to watch"
5. "How do I bake a cake?"

**Edge Cases (Should Handle Gracefully):**
1. "Can you help me budget?" (Financial advice - should help)
2. "What's your name?" (About the bot - should answer)
3. "How can you help me?" (Capabilities - should list banking services)

## Monitoring & Improvement

### Track These Metrics:
1. Number of banking queries vs non-banking attempts
2. User satisfaction with banking responses
3. Common non-banking queries (for documentation)
4. Response accuracy for banking topics

### Regular Reviews:
- Review declined queries to ensure appropriate boundaries
- Update banking capabilities as services expand
- Refine decline messages based on user feedback
- Add new banking topics as needed

## Conclusion

Cardy AI is purpose-built as a **banking-only assistant** that provides professional, secure, and focused banking support. The strict boundaries ensure:
- Professional banking experience
- Security and compliance
- Clear user expectations
- Efficient resource utilization

Users attempting non-banking queries receive polite redirects, maintaining the professional banking image while keeping the conversation on-topic.
